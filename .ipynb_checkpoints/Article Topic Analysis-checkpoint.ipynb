      "assuming you haven't closed your browser window in disgust and disappointment, the next logical step on the road to idea abandonment is to try to convince yourself that your idea is somewhat different than the others.\n",

      "of course, the more you research, the more you see just how similar your idea is to the ones already on the market.\n",
      "you'll eventually close your computer in a fit of rage and think to yourself that it's hopeless; that all the good ideas are taken.\n",

      "once you can accept the fact that coming up with brand new ideas isn't the thing that differentiates most businesses, your mind really becomes open to what's possible and what you can truly accomplish.\n",

      "when you decide you want to do something that other people are already doing, your idea has already been validated.\n",
      "it means you already have a benchmark, or a starting point, from which your idea can grow.\n",

      "what do you do?\n",
      "this time, instead of getting depressed, closing your computer and binge-watching netflix, you make a list of every southern style baby clothes website, facebook page and online community you can find.\n",
      "then you start asking those groups what they want, what they would change if they could and what they dislike about the products they're currently buying.\n",
      "see where this is going?\n",
      "the cool thing about people is they love to tell you what they want.\n",
      "when there are already businesses or freelancers doing what you want to do, go directly to their customers and ask them how you can serve them better.\n",
      "not only will you have a winning idea, but you'll have a customer base to sell to from day one.\n",
      "we call that a win-win.\n",
      "so if you want to be unique, and you want to create something people genuinely want, start making it your mission to find the missing pieces in the market instead of trying to create a new market altogether.\n",
      "related: improve your great idea by listening to what your customers tell you\n",
      "and do yourself a favor -- stop freaking out every time your amazing new idea is already being done by someone else.\n",
      "instead, celebrate whenever you see other people already making money doing what you want to do.\n",
